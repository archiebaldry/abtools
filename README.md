## Features
### Paxels
As the name suggests, a paxel is a combination of the **p**ickaxe, **axe** and shove**l**. Durability is shared across the three functions meaning whilst the multi-tool does save time and space, it will wear out much faster than if you had three seperate tools. In attempt to balance this futher the recipe requires only five units of material as opposed to the seven needed for each individual tool.
